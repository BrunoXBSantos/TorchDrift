data.functional
===============

The corruption functions are modelled after
D. Hendrycks and T. Dietterich: *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations* (ICLR 2019)
and the code provided by their authors in https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness/ but our implementation is expected to differ in details from theirs.
